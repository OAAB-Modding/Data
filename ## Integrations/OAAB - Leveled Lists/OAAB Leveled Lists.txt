OAAB Leveled Lists
by Melchior Dahrk

This mod adds OAAB items to vanilla leveled lists so that you will find these items everywhere in the game where you would find similar vanilla items.

This mod MUST be used with a leveled lists merger if you use any other mods which modify leveled lists.

v3 	Fixed some more infinite recursion that I missed
